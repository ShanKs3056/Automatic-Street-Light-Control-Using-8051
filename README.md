# Automatic-Street-Light-Control-Using-8051
Automatic street light control using 8051 microcontroller can be achieved by interfacing a light sensor with the microcontroller. The light sensor detects the amount of ambient light present and sends the signal to the microcontroller. The microcontroller then switches the street lights ON or OFF depending upon the ambient light level.
